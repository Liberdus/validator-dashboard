# How to Install and Run a Liberdus Validator Node

This guide will walk you through the process of installing and running a Liberdus Validator Node on your system. Please follow the steps below carefully.

## Hardware Requirements

The minimum requirements are:
A VPS server with 2 CPU cores, 2 GB of RAM, 256 GB of SSD, 1 Gbps network, 1 TB/month bandwidth, DDOS protection, power backup and redundant Internet connections.
A Linux Ubuntu OS is highly recommended for easy setup.

A server like this should cost less than $30 per month from a web hosting company.

Although you can run a server from home, it is not recommended since electric power and redundant Internet connections would be lacking and would risk your node getting penalized if it goes down.

## Install Dockers

Do the following as root or a sudo privilaged user:

**For Linux:**

1. Install Package Managers

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
```

2. Update Package Managers:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

3. Install docker

Install docker with docker.io

```bash
sudo apt install docker.io
```

> Verify Docker installation by running `docker --version` (should return version 20.10.12 or higher).

```bash
sudo docker --version
```

4. Install docker-compose

```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
```

> Verify docker-compose installation by running `docker-compose --version` (should return version 1.29.2 or higher).

```bash
sudo docker-compose --version
```

**For MacOS:**

1. Install Package Managers

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Add Homebrew to your `PATH`:

```bash
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"'
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

2. Update Package Managers:

```bash
brew update
```

3. Install docker

```bash
brew install docker
```

> Verify Docker installation by running `docker --version` (should return version 20.10.12 or higher).

4. Install docker-compose

```bash
brew install docker-compose
```

> Verify docker-compose installation by running `docker-compose --version` (should return version 1.29.2 or higher).

## Create a Liberdus User

Do the following as root or a sudo user to create a Liberdus user that will install and run the node:

```bash
sudo adduser liberdus
```

```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo liberdus
```

```bash
su liberdus
```

```bash
cd
```

## Download and Run Installation Script

Do the following as the user created above and not as root.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liberdus/validator-dashboard/main/installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh
```

Follow the instructions provided by the installer script. You can just hit the enter button to accept the default values which should work for most cases.

> If you are behind a router and you are using ports 9001 and 10001 for p2p communication, make sure ports 9001 and 10001, are forwarded (be careful doing this since it will modify your firewall). More info on router port forwarding: <https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide/>

## Starting the Validator

After the installation process completes, you can start the validator using either the web-based dashboard or the command line:

Using Web Dashboard:

- Open a web browser and navigate to the web dashboard at `https://localhost:8080` or https://ServerIP:8080
- Enter the password you set during the installation process.
- Select the **testnet** network from the drop down menu; developer can also select devnet, or localnet.
- Click the `**Start Node**` button to launch your validator node.

Using Command Line:

- Open a terminal and navigate to the Liberdus home directory (`$HOME/.liberdus`).
- Enter the validator container with `./shell`.
- In the container, run `operator-cli start` to start the validator node.
- Run `operator-cli status` to check that it is running.
- Run `operator-cli -h` for list of commands.

### Stake LIB

Once your validator node is running, you can proceed with staking LIB to your node.

1. In the web dashboard, once logged in, you will see your **node address** and a **QR code** for your node address.
2. Open the [Liberdus wallet](https://liberdus.com/download/).
   - If this is your first time using the Liberdus Wallet, create an account by providing a username.
3. Select the **Validator** option in the menu.
5. Click the **Stake** button and copy-paste your node address from the dashboard.
   - If youâ€™re using a phone, you can scan the QR code shown on the dashboard.
4. If you don't have at least **1250 LIB**. you can get some by clicking the **Claim** button.
6. Wait about 15 seconds to get the LIB. Click the **Submit Stake** button to complete the staking process.

After staking, the Web Dashboard will show your staked amount (**1250 LIB or more**) and your node status will update to `Standby` shortly afterward. This indicates that your validator node is set up correctly. The network will then automatically add your validator to the active set based on network load and available validator slots.

### Gracefully stoping the node

Never forse stop your node if it is participating in the network as this will trigger a penalty on the stake amount. 

Always gracefully stop the node.

1. In the validator dashboard, click the **Settings** icon.
2. Uncheck the option for **Auto Restart Node** so that it does not join the network again after it is rotated out.

### Unstake LIB with Reward

Once your validator node is stopped, you can proceed with unstaking the LIB and reward from your node.

1. Open the [Liberdus wallet](https://liberdus.com/download/).
   - Sign In to the same account that you used when staking.
2. Select the **Validator** option in the menu.
3. Click the **Unstake** button and confirm that you want to unstake.
   - If your node is still active or recently stopped you will need to wait before you can unstake.
4. Wait about 15 seconds to get back the staked LIB and reward.
5. If your node was penalized you will get back less than what you staked. Check the validator dashboard for penalty reasons.

## Notification of Software updates

As a node operator it is your responsibility to update the node software when there are new releases. If you do not update the node software, your node will not be allowed to join the network.

There are 3 ways you can be nofied of updates.

1. The validator dashboard will show a message if you need to update the node software version. 
2. You can also subscribe to the node operators mailing list here https://groups.google.com/g/liberdus-node-operators to get announcements.
3. you can also check the node operators announcement channel in the Liberdus Discord to be notified of software updates.

### Update the software

Just run the installer script again to update the validator node software.
Do the following as the user that was created earlier and not as root.

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liberdus/validator-dashboard/main/installer.sh && chmod +x installer.sh && ./installer.sh
```

Follow the instructions provided by the installer script. You can just hit the enter button to accept the default values which should work for most cases.

## Docker management

In most cases you don't need to manage the docker images manually, but the following scripts are provided to make it easier if you do. These should be run as the user that was created during the setup and not as root.

### Start the docker images

```bash
cd .liberdus
./docker-up.sh
```

This will be more effective when the info gathered in the install script is stored in persisent volume that is mounted by the container.

### Stop the docker images

```bash
cd .liberdus
./docker-down.sh
```

### Clean up

```bash
cd .liberdus
./clean.sh
```

This will clean up the last (lastest) build. Just meant to save a few key strokes.
